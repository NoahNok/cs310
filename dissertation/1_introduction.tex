\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}
Within the understanding of how a modern processor operates, we often look into the underlying execution and physics operations performed. Often, being able to visualise processes and ideas is far more beneficial \cite{quratulain_2019_a} to our understanding than simply observing written data such as code or operating diagrams. A visualisation also provides educational benefits, with visual aids helping to increase the understanding of complex material and help reinforce meaning where written material lacks the ability to.

RISC-V \cite{waterman_2019_the} is open source load-store instruction set architecture that has been gaining traction since its major release in 2015. However, despite being only 7 years old and being currently heavily explored, the range of educational tools available to visualise its physical operation are limited. Often limited to just a basic output after emulation. Further, out of the limited tools available, they are burdened with being unintuitive for users with no knowledge of RISC-V.

Thus, the project aims to build up a Simulation tool (including Visualisation and Emulation) for RISC-V from the ground up to provide a tool for individuals and educators to increase their understanding of RISC-V through a visual approach. Following the RISC-V specification \cite{waterman_2011_the} mostly to provide a rigid understanding, whilst keeping a simplified approach to avoid overburdening the end user. The project being a simulator over just being an emulator means we are able to provide a visual aspect, rather than just running RISC-V code, which provides a better learning experience for those using the end application. The differences are discussed in Section \ref{sec:sim_vs_em}.

RISC-V provides a 32 bit base specification to use, however the specification also provides extensions. These exist so that RISC-V may incorporate more modern features to improve performance and increase capability. Some of these extensions include: Multiply and Divide, and Floating Point Extensions. An addition to the project would be to include some of these basic extensions within the final application to provide a wider range of simulation. This could be approached in multiple ways, two of which may be to directly hard-code them into the core application to provide a concrete and reliable implementation of extensions, or to provide them as additional modules via a module system supplying a simple method to load and unload modules to add/remove complexity, whilst enabling future modules to be created independently of the base application. Of these two cases, the modular approach is the most appropriate, allowing for its mentioned benefits and ability to split up the whole project into smaller chunks.
